/**
 * Instructions:
 *
 * The following is a poorly written comment handler. Your task will be to refactor
 * the code to improve its structure, performance, and security with respect to the
 * below requirements. Make any changes you feel necessary to improve the code or
 * data structure. The code doesn't need to be runnable we just want to see your
 * structure, style and approach.
 *
 * If you are unfamiliar with PHP, it is acceptable to recreate this functionality
 * in the language of your choice. However, PHP is preferred.
 *
 * Comment Handler Requirements
 * - Users can write a comment
 * - Users can write a reply to a comment
 * - Users can reply to a reply (Maximum of 2 levels in nested comments)
 * - Comments (within in the same level) should be ordered by post date
 * - Address any data security vulnerabilities
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * comments_table
 * -id
 * -parent_id (0 - designates top level comment)
 * -name
 * -comment
 * -create_date
